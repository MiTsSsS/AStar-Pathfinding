# Introduction
  
- This is an implementation of the A* Pathfinding algorithm in a grid based game in Unity.  
- The A* algorithm aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (the cost being the least distance travelled, shortest time, etc...).  
- In the case of this project, the A* algorithm is used to find the shortest path to the target node.
